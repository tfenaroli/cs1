When I run the code, I see a bunch of sporadic ellipses popping up with random colors and the statement: “Welcome to CS1”. These are all in the upper section of the canvas (they do not occupy the bottom portion of the canvas), and the ellipses keep on appearing and do not stop. The ellipses are also slightly transparent, and you can see the text from the other ellipses behind them.
