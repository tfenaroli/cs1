My next step will be to create a function called determine_paddle_contact that, when the ball is between the vertical bounds of the paddle and the ballâ€™s center + its radius is past the paddle (on either the right of left paddle), will return True. Once this is done, I will create global variables vx and vy (random), and flip vx when paddle contact is true, and flip vy when a function determine_horizontal_contact is true. Then, I will have the basics of pong.
